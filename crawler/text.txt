The better answer may be the approach taken by a news aggregator website named Reddit.com, the brainchild of two 22-year-old graduates from the University of Virginia, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian.
Reddit.com is certainly not the first to harness collaborative filtering: sites such as Kuro5hin and Slashdot pioneered user-driven content, with Digg.com a more sophisticated recent version. But while those sites are primarily interested in technology news, Reddit is aimed at general readers.
The site has only been running since mid-July, after Huffman and Ohanian were among the first group of start-ups supported by the innovative Y Combinator seed fund, set up by net guru Paul Graham and others. The pair have received further funding, with the site now being visited by about 12,000 users each day.

Башак Тосун от Уикипедия Турция
Как стана уикимедианец, разкажи ни историята си?
Това стана отдавна през 2005-та. Спомням си, че получих по мейл покана да редактирам турската Уикипедия, мейл от група, към която бях абонирана. По това време пишех блог и допринасях за няколко сайта по темите за пътуване, книги и други, като хоби. Когато научих, че мога да редактирам и Уикипедия бях развълнувана и знаех, че ше ми хареса, дори преди да бях започнала да редактирам.
Когато се завърнах споделих опита си с другите онлайн и скоро се оказах сред основателите на нашата потребителска група в Турция. Много обичам да съм с други уикимедианци от целия свят на регионални и международни събития, като мост между моята общност и уикимедианското движение. Сега членувам в още две международни потребителски групи и съм член на Affiliations Commitee.
Кои са любимите ти Уики проекти, по които работиш?
Уикипедия на турски! Обичам да редактрам на родния си език. Мисля, че Уикипедия на турски е далеч от там, където следва да е като количество и качество на статиите и съм уверена, че моите редакции могат да доведат до промяна. Също много обичам да допринасям за Комънс със снимки, които да използвам към статиите, които редактирам.
В Турция имахте доста сложен период с блокирането на Уикипедия. Това, за радост, отмина. Как се чувстваш от тази ситуация и какво научихте от нея?
Да, Уикипедия бе блокирана в Турция от 29 април 2017 до 15 януари 2020. Хората, които имат по-голяма компютърна грамотност можеха да избегнат блокажа с използване на технологии като VPN. Толкова се гордея с редакторите от нашата общност, които не спряха да редактират Уикипедия и нашата потребителска група продължи да организира събития през тези години. Въпреки всички малки редакции се случваха и оценявахме още по-високо стойността им. Повечето хора от общността допринасят, защото виждат това като добър начин да оползотворят свободното си време, но мисля, че и доста от нас оценяваме колко е ценно това, което правим за обществото като цяло и започваме да виждаме не само като добър начин да запълним времето си, но и като важна доброволческа работа. Ето защо решихме, че вместо да сме неформална общност е добре да сме по-хубаво организирани и след махането на блокажа придобихме статус на неправителствена организация.
Къде е в момента турската уики-общност и как я развивате?
Турската уики общност е по-жива от всякога. Общуваме основно с не-уики канали като Телеграм, за да искаме помощ за превод на определени думи, изречения или да си сътрудничим по други теми. Имаме редовни онлайн срещи всеки две седмици. По-опитните уикипедианци и новите участват в разговори, споделят предложения за различни проекти, събития, правим различни презентации, за да се учим и развиваме. Правим доста неща едновременно. Тази година за първи път организирахме Уики Обича Земята Турция. Имаше неочаквано високо участие. Очаквахме около 500 снимки да се качат за месец, а имахме получени близо 3500 снимки. Мислим, че това е голям поздрав от читателите към завърналата се Уикипедия.
Как Уикипедия помага, работи за хората в страни като вашата?
Турция е държава с добро потребление на Интернет и хората използват онлайн източници като основен източник на информация. Въпреки това информационната среда в Турция е силно замърсена. В тази среда Уикипедия не може да бъде пазач срещу фалшивата информация, но поне дава на по-напредналите потребители на Интернет подкрепа за фактологичното знание, неговото създаване и споделяне.
Твоят поздрав към уикипедианците и приятелите, които ще прочетат това интервю?
Скъпи приятели, толкова се гордея, че съм част от тази общност и очаквам да можем отново да сме заедно на събития.

Basak Tosun from Wikimedia Turkey
How did you become a Wikimedian, tell us your story?
Your most liked Wiki projects you work for?
Turkish wikipedia! I like editing in my native language. I belive Turkish wikipedia is still far behind where it should be in terms of number and quality of articles and i can feel my edits could make an important change. I also very much like contributing to Commons with images that could be useful in the articles i edited.
You had this hard time with Wikipedia in Turkey. Now it is over. Some lessons learned and how do you feel now about it?
So where is the Turkish Wiki community now and how do you develop it?
How Wikipedia helps, works for people in countries like yours?
Your greeting to the Wikipedians and friends who read this interview?
Dear friends, i am so proud to be a member of such community and i am looking forward to be able to come together with you at a in-person event.

Каква е ролята ти в Уикимедианското движение сега?
Уикимедианската общност е голяма, цветна, включваща. Как тази култура се разпространява? Как расте? Как се защитава?
Каква е ролята на Уикимедианското движение в ежедневието на хората, например в Индия, Гана или Канада? Как Уикимедия, не само като платформа за свободно знание, но и като движение променя живота на хората?
Кой е любимият ти Уики проект?
Нямам любим проект. Постоянно съм възхитена от многото лица на уикимедианското движение.
Твоят поздрав за Уики и не-Уики хората, които четат това интервю?
Изпращам Уики-любов на всички хора, които четат това. Останете любопитни, пазете вярата си в доброто и критичното си мислене и споделяйте знанията си свободно!

What is your role in the Wiki movement now?
By now I have two roles in the movement. I am a volunteer editor who
loves to write short articles for the German Wikipedia and to upload
pictures to commons and to take part in world wide events and
edit-a-thons. And I am a staff member of the Wikimedia Foundation, a
Trust and Safety Specialist.
Wikimedian community is lange, colourful, inclusive. How this culture is spread? How it grows? How it is protected?
I am also not sure about the role of the Wikimedia movement in
everyday life of people in other countries, or even in my own
countries. For me, there are morning and evening slots where I do my
volunteer editing or just look at what amazing things other volunteers
have done recently. And when I chat with my friends all over the world who are amazing Wikimedians. And well, during the workday, it is very much part of all I do, of course!
I do not really have a favourite project. I am again and again
fascinated by the many facettes this movement has.
Your greeting to all the Wiki and non-Wiki people who will read this interview?
Sending Wikilove to all people who read this,. Stay curious, keep your
good faith and critical thinking and share your knowledge freely!

Justice Okai-Allotey from Wikimedia Ghana User Group
Please tell us your story about Wikipedia? How did your involvement start?
After four years of being actively involved in volunteering for Wikimedia Ghana User Group and the Wikimedia Foundation I can say I am more active in editing Eglish Wikipedia. Also because of my photography background I have contributed a lot of images from events I covered for our user group also to Wikimedia commons.
What is important for you in Wiki movement and why you are part of it?
How Wikimedia is changing the life of people in Africa?
Your most favourite Wiki project?
English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.
And what are the biggest challenges you face running wiki projects in your community?
Your greeting to all people who read this interview?
I would love to say a great Thank You to everyone reading this interview and for supporting the various Wiki projects. Namaste.

Джъстис Окай-Алоти: Уикипедия променя живота на хората в Африка
Джъстис е млад, енергичен, усмихнат и всеотдаен уикипедианец от Гана. Знаем, че в Африка има много голяма нужда от знание и Уикипедия за много хора там е почти единствен източник на знания. За предизвикателствата и възможностите за сободно знание днес разговаряме с Джъстис.
Разкажи ни историята си с Уикипедия?
Преди да започна да редактират Уикипедия бях силен потребител на Уикипедия, най-вече докато спорех с мои приятели и търсех аргументи по теми, свързани със спорт и други. Приятелите ми повтаряха, че Уикипедия може да се редактира от всеки и с това не може да й се вярва. На 20 февруари 2016 година присъствах на първия си Уикимедиански едит-а-тон на Уики потребителската ни група в Гана и се заинтересувах от редактирането на Уикипедия. От ден на ден се интересувах повече и повече и след това се включих в Уики обича паметниците, като допринесох със снимки на паметници, които бях правил. Започнах да доброволствам и в потребителската група с различни дейности и така, след 4 години мога да кажа, че вече имам дълъг път в Уикимедианското движение.
А с какво се занимаваш днес? По какви уики проекти работите в Гана?
След четири години активно включване с доброволство за потребителската ни група Уикимедиа Гана и Фондация Уикимедия, вече съм по-активен в редактирането на Уикипедия на английски. Също, защото имам опит с фотография, допринасям с много снимки от събития.
Какво е важно за теб в Уикимедианското движение и защо си част от него?
Една от най-важните причини за мен да се присъединя към Уикимедианското движение е целта да се споделя цялото знание. Това мото така силно резонира с мен, че се присъединих веднага към Уикипедия. Към момента считам решението си да чета и допринасям за Уикипедия за едно от най-добрите в моя живот.
Как Уикимедия променя живота на хората в Африка?
Кои са твоите любими Уики проекти?
Английската Уикипедия и Уики Комънс.
А кои са най-големите предизвикателства, пред които е изправено вашата уики общност?
Твоето пожелание към хората, които четат това интервю?
Искам да кажа голямо Благодаря на всеки, които е прочел това интервю и помага за различните Уики проекти. Намасте.
Уики доброволци по света

Vahid really inspiring person, wikipedian and open education visioner! He is currently employed by Learning Equality, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing digital learning resources to schools and communities that are offline, where he contributes to the contents team.
Tell us the story between you and open knowledge? How it all started and what are the main projects you are involved in?
And how Wikipedia came up in your life?
And how Wikipedia complements the open culture and open education movement?
How open education and understanding about it change the world we live in?
For those that are interested in Open education in practice, i suggest looking at OER-enabled Pedagogy, which is one particular application of open education. You can find many links about it in Google Scholar, and on Twitter.
I am very thankful for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts with the Bulgarian WM community, and i have to say i miss CEE meetings and their never-boring dynamics! I hope everyone is well and taking care of themselves in this testing period in our lifetimes.

Вахид Масрур: знанието е процесът, който разгръща крилата на човечеството за по-добро и прави света по-добър
Дълги години Вахид Масрур беше част от Фондация Уикимедия и работеше по различни проекти, свързани с образование и отворено знание. В момента работи в екипа за съдържание към неправителствената организация Learning Equality, чиято дейност е посветена на това училищата и общностите да имат достъп до дигиталните ресурси за учене.
Разкажи ни за връзката между теб и свободното знание. Как започна всичко и с какви проекти си ангажиран днес?
Как Уикипедия дойде в живота ти?
Как Уикипедия допълва отворената култура и движението за отворено образование?
Как свободното образование и разбирането за него променят света, в който живеем?
Отвореното образование е възможност да се преосмисли как правим образование. Привлече се вниманието около това как се създават учебни материали с почти нулев разход, но за мен по-важната тема тук е дискутирането на това как образователните системи могат да работят в 21-ви век, вместо в 19-ти. В това са големите ползи на отвореното образование.
Къде може да се прочете повече по тези теми?
За хората с практически интерес към свободното образование предлагам да погледнат за OER-enabled Pedagogy, което е приложение за отворено образование. Много линкове по темата има и в Google Scholar, и в Twitter.
Твоят поздрав към всички уикипедианци, които ще прочетат това интервю?
Благодарен съм за възможността да споделя част от мислите си с българската уикимедианска общност и ми се ще да кажа, че ми липсват срещите на Централно- и Източноевропейската уики общност и голямата им динамика! Надявам се всички сте добре и да се грижите за себе си в този тестови период на нашия живот.

How did the relationship between you and Wikipedia start?At the beginning I met Bachounda, who manages the Wikimedia community in Algeria, through my photography club, we often organize events around photography where the Wiki Loves Africa competitions or Wiki loves monuments are represented with exhibitions.Our relationship quickly becomes friendly, and we work together to ensure that our projects are linked, I quickly become a jury for these contests and here I am participating in my first community meeting in Tunis in 2018, WikiIndaba!!
What are the languages you contribute in, as you speak a few?As I said before, I contribute more in image, so in a universal language, I speak French and English, Algerian Arabic is my mother tongue, and I start to learn Spanish but I confess not being a big contributor in articles.

На почетната страна од редит се прикажани насловни страни од содржината на одредени субредитори. Постои стандарден сет, но регистрираните корисници можат да приглагодат.
Заедницата Редит овозможува корисниците да се дружат приватно низ парковите и баровите по целиот свет со тоа што има многу субредитори кои ги организираат овие месни средби.
Редит користи PostgreSQL како примарна податочкна база, но полека поминува во Апачи Касандра, колона ориентирана податочна база. 
За првпат во 2009-тата година Реддит почна да користи и jQuery.
Реддит има свое API, како и соодветни апликации за сите мобилни платформи.

Вие сте добре дошли да се включите като сътрудник, редактор или автор, но трябва да спазвате правилата, възприети при редактирането на всяка независима версия на проектите. Най-големият проект е Уикипедия, но имаме и други проекти, всеки с различни цели и методи на работа. Всеки проект има свой екип от сътрудници, редактори и автори, които работят съвместно, за да създават и управляват съдържанието на съответната версия. Приканваме Ви да станете част от този екип и да сътрудничите за подобряването на проектите. Тъй като сме се посветили на създаването на свободно достъпно публично съдържание, ние най-общо се стремим всички приноси да бъдат под свободен лиценз или да са обществено достояние.

Декларация за поверителност
3. Съдържание, което поддържаме
4. Въздържане от определени действия
Проектите, поддържани от Фондация Уикимедия, съществуват единствено в резултат на действията на активна и жизнена общност от потребители като Вас, които си сътрудничат в писането, редактирането и организирането на съдържание. Ние с радост приветстваме Вашето участие в тази общност. Приканваме Ви да бъдете любезни и учтиви във взаимоотношенията си с другите членове на общността, да действате добросъвестно и да правите редакции и приноси, насочени към по-нататъшното осъществяване на мисията на колективния проект.
Определени дейности, законни или не, може да нанесат вреда на други потребители и да нарушат нашите правила, а освен това, заради извършването на някои видове дейности Вие може да бъдете подведени под отговорност. Ето защо, за Ваша собствена сигурност и за тази на останалите потребители, Вие нямате право да вземате участие в такива дейности на нашите сайтове. Тези дейности включват:

ЧЗВ за разкриване на платени приноси
Запазваме си правото да упражним преценка при прилагането на гореизложените условия.
Вие отговаряте за защитата на собствената си парола и никога не трябва да я разкривате на трети лица.
Политика за търговските марки
7. Лицензиране на съдържанието
За увеличаване на обема на свободното знание и за развитие на свободната култура всички потребители, които допринасят за проектите, трябва да предоставят на широката общественост пълни права за свободно повторно разпространение и повторно използване на своите приноси, доколкото това използване е прецизно приписано на автора, както и да предоставите същата свобода за повторна употреба и повторно разпространение за всички производни произведения. В съответствие с нашата цел за предоставяне на безплатна информация на възможно най-широка публика, ние изискваме, когато е необходимо, цялото предоставено съдържание да бъде лицензирано, така че да е свободно за многократна употреба от всеки, който желае достъп до него.
Вие се съгласявате със следните изисквания за лицензиране:
Лиценза Криейтив Комънс Признание-Споделяне на споделеното 3.0 Нелокализиран
Лиценза за свободна документация на ГНУ
Правила за лицензиране
Също така имайте предвид, че текст, чийто източник е външен ресурс и който е бил внесен в проект, може да бъде защитен с лиценз, предполагащ допълнителни изисквания за указване на авторство и позоваване на източника. Потребителите се съгласяват да се придържат стриктно към тези допълнителни изисквания за указване на авторството и източника. В зависимост от проекта, подобни изисквания могат да бъдат съобщавани например чрез банер или с други означения, указващи, че цялото или част от съдържанието на страницата първоначално е било публикувано другаде. Там, където са налице такива видими обозначения, потребителите са длъжни да ги запазят при следваща употреба на съдържанието.
Ако сте собственик на съдържание, което се използва неправомерно в рамките на някой от проектите без Ваше разрешение, в съответствие с нормите на DMCA Вие можете да поискате то да бъде премахнато. За да подадете съответното заявление, пишете на ел. поща: legal  wikimedia.org или се свържете с нашия упълномощен представител по обикновена поща на следния адрес.
От друга страна, можете да подадете заявление до нашата общност, която често пъти се справя по-бързо и по-ефективно с проблемите, свързани с авторските права, отколкото мерките в DMCA. В този случай Вие можете да публикувате съобщение с описание на своите проблеми относно авторските права. Тук е представен непълният неофициален списък на съответните процедури, отнасящи се до различните варианти на проектите ни. Преди да подадете иск за нарушение на нормите на DMCA, вие също така разполагате и с опцията да изпратите писмо по електронната поща до общността на следния адрес: info  wikimedia.org.
9. Уебсайтове и ресурси на трети страни
10. Управление на уебсайтовете
Общността има основна цел да създава и следи за спазването на политики, действащи по отношение на различните раздели на нашите проекти. Във Фондация Уикимедия ние рядко се намесваме в процесите на вземане на решения относно политиките и тяхното прилагане. В някои изключителни случаи може да възникне необходимост, или общността може да се обърне към нас, да се справим с възникналите по отношение на даден потребител затруднения, свързани със значителни нарушения на правилата на проект или опасно поведение от негова страна. В такива случаи ние си запазваме правото, но нямаме задължение да:
В интерес на нашите проекти, на участниците в тях и на потребителите, в крайни случаи, когато сметка или достъп на участник са били блокирани по силата на тази разпоредба, той или тя нямат права да създават или използват друга сметка или да получават достъп в същия проект, освен ако ние не дадем изричното си съгласие. Без да ограничава правомощията на общността, Фондация Уикимедия сама по себе си няма да забранява на участниците да редактират или да публикуват материали, а също и няма да блокира сметки на участници или техния достъп до проектите, единствено поради конструктивна критика, което не води до действия, които по някакъв друг начин нарушават настоящите Условия за ползване или правилата на общността.
Политиката за глобална забрана
Блокирането на сметка или достъп или налагането на забрана за достъп на потребител по силата на тази разпоредба се извършва в съответствие с раздел 12 от настоящите Условия за ползване.
11. Решения на Фондация Уикимедия и правила на проектите
Управителният съвет на Фондация Уикимедия периодично оповестява официалните правила. Някои от тези правила могат да бъдат задължителни за конкретен проект или негова версия, а когато са определени като задължителни, Вие се съгласявате да се придържате към тях.
13. Спорове и юрисдикция

14. Отказ от отговорност
Изтеглянето на различни материали или получаването им по друг начин чрез ползването на нашите услуги се извършва по Ваша собствена преценка и на Ваш риск и единствено Вие ще сте отговорни в случай на повреда на компютърната Ви система или при загуба на данни вследствие на такова изтегляне на материали. Вие се съгласявате, че ние не носим никаква отговорност и нямаме правно задължение при изтриване или невъзможност да бъдат съхранени или прехвърлени каквито и да е материали или съобщения, поддържани от нашата услуга. Запазваме си правото по собствена преценка да създаваме ограничения за употребата и съхранението на информационни материали, по всяко време със или без уведомление.
В някои щати или юрисдикции не се допускат откази от отговорност като изложените в настоящия раздел, така че те може частично или изцяло да се окажат неприложими спрямо Вас, в зависимост от закона.
15. Ограничение на отговорността
16. Изменения на настоящите Условия за ползване
Настоящите Условия за ползване не създават отношения на заетост, представителство, партньорство или съвместно предприятие между Вас и нас, Фондация Уикимедия. Ако не сте подписали отделно споразумение с нас, настоящите Условия за ползване представляват възможно най-изчерпателното споразумение между Вас и нас. Ако е налице противоречие между настоящите Условия за ползване и подписаното между Вас и нас писмено споразумение, предимство има писменото споразумение.
Вие се съгласявате, че ние можем да Ви изпращаме уведомления, в това число за приети изменения в Условията за ползване, посредством електронна поща, обикновена поща или чрез публикации на уебстраниците на нашите проекти.
Ако при някакви обстоятелства не приложим или не изпълним някоя разпоредба от настоящите Условия за ползване, това не означава отказ от тази разпоредба.
Вие осъзнавате, че, освен ако не е уговорено друго с нас в писмена форма, Вие не следва да очаквате, че ще получите възнаграждение за каквито и да било дейност, принос или идея, които Вие предоставяте на нас, на общността, както и на проектите на Уикимедия или различните им версии.
Ако бъде установено, че някоя разпоредба или част от разпоредба от настоящите Условия за ползване е незаконна, невалидна или неприложима, тази разпоредба или част от разпоредба се счита за делима от настоящите Условия за ползване и ще бъде реализирана в максимално допустимата степен, като всички останали разпоредби на настоящите Условия за ползване остават в пълна сила и действие.

5.3 Changes to This Privacy Policy
The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and Wiktionary.
This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information.
By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.
The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.
We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.
We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.
thematic organizations
Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.
For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:
This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.
the Donor Privacy Policy
Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension
Access to Nonpublic Information Policy
online ticketing system
movement organizations
Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.
Your Public Contributions
Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.
Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.
You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.
You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.
If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address.
If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.
You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.
If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password.
Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about using your real name as your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse. No other personal information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card information.
Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.
Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites
We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.
Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.
We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, may need to share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.
Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to Nonpublic Information Policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.
To Our Service Providers
We may disclose personal information to our third party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

Sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.
Because You Made It Public
Information that you post is public and can been seen and used by everyone.

Новинарски сайт, или наричан още онлайн вестник е електронния вариант на печатен вестник, като може да бъде или независимо издание или просто онлайн версия на издание, което се разпространява и в книжна форма. В този тип сайтове се публикуват главно новини и репортажи от различни сфери.
Новинарските сайтове спазват същите закони за клевета, неприкосновеност на данните и авторско право, с които се съобразява и печатната преса. За разлика от традиционните журналисти тези, които работят в сферата на онлайн медиите обикновено се занимават и със снимане на видео, като, също така, адаптират стила си на писане към изискванията на онлайн медиите.

Weekend City Press Review
Very few newspapers in 2006 claimed to have made money from their websites, which were mostly free to all viewers. Declining profit margins and declining circulation in daily newspapers forced executives to contemplate new methods of obtaining revenue from websites, without charging for the subscription. This has been difficult. Newspapers with specialized audiences such as The Wall Street Journal and The Chronicle of Higher Education successfully charge subscription fees. Most newspapers have an online edition, including The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, Mid Day, and The New York Times.

Tingkat kepercayaan pembaca terhadap kualitas dan merek dari suatu surat kabar ternama, berikut kemampuannya menjaring pengiklan, dapat pula disaksikan dari kemampuan surat kabar ini bertahan. Pengalihan bentuk dari cetak ke daring maupun penambahan bentuk dari cetak saja menjadi cetak dan daring, akan mampu meningkatkan efisiensi biaya produksi. Seperti halnya versi cetak, surat kabar daring dituntut untuk tunduk pada etika jurnalisme, dan perangkat aturan lain terkait hak cipta, privasi, dan sejenisnya.
Kemajuan teknologi komputer memberikan dampak signifikan dalam dunia jurnalistik.Diawali dengan pengalihan metode manual ke jurnalistik yang berbasis komputerisasi. Dilanjutkan dengan premis bahwa keanggunan inovasi dan modifikasi di dunia komputer cenderung membawa angin segar bagi kemajuan dunia jurnalistik. Pengelolaan, pengiriman dan penyimpanan data, pemanggilan kembali diikuti rentetan proses jurnalistik lain berlipat kali lebih mudah.
1 Jenis surat kabar daring
2 Surat kabar daring di Indonesia
3 Keunggulan surat kabar daring
4 Kelemahan surat kabar daring
5 Beberapa portal surat kabar daring di Indonesia
Surat kabar daring dibedakan menjadi dua jenis utama. Yakni, hanya surat kabar daring dan surat kabar hibrid. Versi pertama merujuk pada eksistensi surat kabar online yang terpisah dengan surat kabar cetak. Terpisah artinya konten maupun keberadaan surat kabar daring ini tidak menyertai versi cetaknya, seperti detik.com, okezone.com, dan vivanews.com. Sedangkan yang dimaksud surat kabar hibrid adalah di samping berbasis jaringan, surat kabar daring ini menyediakan versi cetak pula. Contohnya kompas.com yang berhibrid dengan Kompas cetak dengan versi cetaknya pada Koran Tempo dan Harian Warta Nasional.
Empat fungsi utama media massa, yakni pengawasan lingkungan, korelasi sosial, sosialisasi, dan hiburan menuntut keluasan ruang kebebasan berekspresi. Sebelum reformasi bergulir kebebasan ini terpasung sedemikian rupa hingga fungsi pengawasan lingkungan yang juga mencakup pengawasan terhadap pemerintah tidak berjalan sebagaimana mestinya. Media yang dianggap membahayakan pemerintah dapat saja dibredel. Hal ini tidak sejalan dengan Indonesia yang menganut asasdemokrasi, di mana media seharusnya menjadi tonggak keempat setelah eksekutif, legislatif, yudikatif, dan yang menopang keseimbangan jalan sebuah Negara.
pengawasan lingkungan
Format daring mulai dilirik selepas pembredelan yang menimpa beberapa surat kabar nasional di era orde baru. Pertama kali pada tahun 1996 surat kabar daring berdiri. Satu persatu surat kabar daring tumbuh setelahnya, dan ikut mengawal bergulirnya reformasi.
Masyarakat yang semakin akrab dengan teknologi internet menjadi salah satu alasan cepatnya perkembangan surat kabar daring di Indonesia. Kemampuan media ini menyajikan berita secara singkat, cepat, mudah diakses, dan murah menjadi dasar preferensi konsumen surat kabar daring, terutama pada masa kritis seperti bencana alam, kerusuhan, dan kondisi serupa yang memungkinkan situasi berubah dalam hitungan detik.
Keunggulan utama surat kabar daring adalah kecepatan dan kebaruan berita yang terjaga sepanjang waktu. Beritanya tidak pernah basi. Reporter juga dapat mengirimkan berita dalam jumlah yang tak terbatas ke bank data berita surat kabar terkait. Meskipun pada akhirnya editor yang akan menentukan berita mana yang akan diunggah, tetap saja hal ini menjamin ketersediaan dan keragaman konten dalam bank data. Model daring juga sangat berperan dalam penghematan biaya produksi. Jika pada versi cetak selalu ada kemungkinan eksemplar yang dicetak tidak habis terjual, tidak demikian halnya dengan versi daring. Surat kabar daringmemastikan tidak perlu anggaran khusus untuk tinta, cetak, dan kertas. Selain itu, pengelolaannya juga relatif mudah dan hemat tenaga. Di samping efisiensi, surat kabar daring juga unggul dalam efektivitas penyampaian pesan. Berita yang diunggah diklasifikasikan dalam beragam kategori yang bebas diakses secara gratis oleh pembaca.
Kecepatan di satu sisi merupakan keunggulan utama berita daring. Namun, di sisi lain kecepatan tak jarang mengabaikan akurasi pemberitaan. Pemberitaan daring sering mengorbankan aspek konfirmasi yang termasuk poin penting dalam karya jurnalistik. Dalam konteks domestik, kemudahan untuk mengakses surat kabar daring masih terbatas bagi sebagian kalangan, terutama kalangan menengah atas, perkotaan, dan mahasiswa. Kondisi sosial, ekonomi, dan demografi Indonesia belum memungkinkan seluruh lapisan masyarakat memiliki akses yang setara terhadap berita daring.
Mengiring perkembangan surat kabar daring, jurnalisme daring pun berkembang di Indonesia. Penulisan surat kabar daring tidak lepas dari kaidah dan prinsip jurnalistik daring. Prinsip tersebut dirumuskan dalam lima kaidah, yakni ringkas, mengadaptasi kebutuhan dan preferensi publik, dapat dipindai, pelibatan khalayak, serta prinsip komunikasi dan penjaringan komunitas. Jenis jurnalisme daring dibedakan berdasarkan dua kategori. Kategori pertama, adalah rentang antara situs yang berkonsentrasi pada editorial konten dan koneksivitas publik. Kategori berikutnya dibedakan menurut tingkatan komunikasi partisipatoris, terdiri dari situs terbuka dan situs tertutup. Jurnalisme daring sendiri terbagi menjadi empat jenis, mainstream news sites index and category sites, meta and comment sites, serta share and discussion sites.
index and category sites
serta share and discussion sites
Sumber pendapatan terbesar surat kabar daring berasal dari iklan. Beberapa portal surat kabar daring juga memperoleh dana dari pelanggan berita di daerah. Pelanggan berita yang dimaksud biasanya terdiri dari surat kabar daerah yang membeli konten berita nasional dari situs surat kabar daring nasional.

The Trials of Apollo, Book Three: The Burning Maze
The formerly glorious god Apollo, cast down to earth in punishment by Zeus, is now an awkward mortal teenager named Lester Papadopoulos. In order to regain his place on Mount Olympus, Lester must restore five Oracles that have gone dark. But he has to achieve this impossible task without having any godly powers and while being duty-bound to a confounding young daughter of Demeter named Meg. Thanks a lot, Dad. With the help of some demigod friends, Lester managed to survive his first two trials, one at Camp Half-Blood, and one in Indianapolis, where Meg received the Dark Prophecy. The words she uttered while seated on the Throne of Memory revealed that an evil triumvirate of Roman emperors plans to attack Camp Jupiter. While Leo flies ahead on Festus to warn the Roman camp, Lester and Meg must go through the Labyrinth to find the third emperor--and an Oracle who speaks in word puzzles--somewhere in the American Southwest. There is one glimmer of hope in the gloom-filled prophecy: The cloven guide alone the way does know. They will have a satyr companion, and Meg knows just who to call upon. . . .

You may also choose to opt out of Google LLC or its affiliates informing a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for payment to that merchant.
If you choose to opt out, your choice will be effective until you tell us to change your choice.
Google Payments privacy settings page
We will not share your personal information with anyone outside of GPC or with our affiliates except as described in this privacy notice. As explained above, Google Payments is a product offered to Google Account holders. Data that you provide to Google LLC for the purpose of signing up for a Google Account is not affected by the opt-out provisions in this notice.

Our surest path to success is to make something people love.

The free flow of ideas and feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy organization, and Reddit must embrace it if we are to thrive.

Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Reddit users.
Every community on Reddit is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the community as moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members. Please abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in which you are not a member.
Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on Reddit. These rules are enforced by us, the admins.
Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well.
Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
identity or vulnerability
personal or confidential information
intimate or sexually-explicit media
Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.
sexual or suggestive content involving minors
Ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.
Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.
illegal or prohibited transactions
We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited to
Management of your own Community
Remember the Content Policy
Management of Multiple Communities
Moderators are important to the Reddit ecosystem. In order to have some consistency:
Please describe what your community is, so that all users can find what they are looking for on the site.
Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.
Please provide an email address for us to contact you. While not always needed, certain security tools may require use of email address so that we can contact you and verify who you are as a moderator of your community.
We know management of multiple communities can be difficult, but we expect you to manage communities as isolated communities and not use a breach of one set of community rules to ban a user from another community. In addition, camping or sitting on communities for long periods of time for the sake of holding onto them is prohibited.
Where moderators consistently are in violation of these guidelines, Reddit may step in with actions to heal the issues - sometimes pure education of the moderator will do, but these actions could potentially include dropping you down the moderator list, removing moderator status, prevention of future moderation rights, as well as account deletion. We hope permanent actions will never become necessary.

What are cookies and how does Reddit use them?
How do I control cookies and how my data is used?
Last updated September 15, 2020.
This Cookie Notice explains how we use cookies and similar technologies as well as the options you have to control them.
Strictly Necessary: These cookies are necessary for our services to function properly and securely and cannot be switched off in our systems. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but then some parts of the site will not work. These include:
Functional: These cookies enable Reddit to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these features may not function properly.
Analytics and Performance: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.
Advertising: We use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to users, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns, both on our services and on other sites or mobile apps. Our third-party advertising partners may use these cookies to build a profile of your interests and deliver relevant advertising on other sites.
Third-Party Sites: Third parties who advertise on Reddit may use our advertising technology, including our advertising pixel, on their sites. We may serve advertising cookies when you visit their sites so that we can measure the effectiveness of ads on Reddit and to show you more relevant advertising on Reddit. The placement of these cookies is controlled by the third-party sites.
There are a number of ways you can control how information is collected from cookies on Reddit and how that information is used.
Your browser includes controls that allow you to manage the use of cookies by the sites that you visit. Most browsers have features that enable you to see and delete cookies stored on your device and to block cookies from all or selected sites. For more information, here are links to external help materials from some of the popular browsers:
Your mobile device may also include browser settings that allow you to manage the use of cookies, especially if the device supports installing apps such as iOS and Android devices. iOS and Android devices also include additional device settings that control whether advertising partners can use information about your app activity for advertising purposes. On iOS, you can search for a setting called Limit Ad Tracking. On Android, you can search for a setting called Opt out of Ads Personalization.
The major online advertising industry groups offer tools to limit how cookies are used for advertising purposes by participating third parties. More information is available on these sites from the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and for users in the EU, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Also, Google provides web users with the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent the collection of data via Google Analytics.

How We Use Information About You
How Information About You Is Shared
Ads and Analytics Partners
We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:
Actions you take. We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.
Other information. You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.
When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:
We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here.
Information collected from integrations. We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party websites that integrate our Services, including our embeds, buttons, and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a website that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here.
When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example:
Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:
We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:
As a Reddit user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you.
You can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here.
You can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here.
We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.
You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.
With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.
If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information.
We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.
Privacy Shield website.
As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA only where we have legal bases for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. We process your information on the following legal bases:
Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.
We have also appointed a representative in the EU to receive inquiries about our data practices:

Our Approach to Content Moderation
Content Removed from Reddit
Requests for User Information
Transparency Report 2019
This year, we have expanded our Transparency Report to include more information on content removed from Reddit, including Reddit Content Policy removals, Content Manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines. This additional information increases transparency for our users and helps show our support for initiatives such as The Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation.
The Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation
Reports for previous years can be found here.
Chart 1: Total amount of content created vs. content removed from Reddit in 2019
The vast majority of content removals on Reddit are executed within individual subreddits by Mods. In 2019, Mods removed 84,140,588 pieces of content from Reddit. This represents the vast majority of all non-spam content removals on Reddit in 2019. These removals are largely based on individual subreddit rules that are unique to each community and set by the moderators and communities themselves. While there may be overlap between enforcement of these rules and the Reddit Content Policy, Moderator actions are entirely separate from removals carried out by Reddit Administrators.
Content Policy Removals
Chart 4: Pieces of content removed by Admins for Content Policy violations
Chart 5: Accounts removed or suspended for content policy violations
If entire communities are found to be in violation of our Content Policy, they may be removed. Communities may also be removed if they lack active moderation, in accordance with our Moderator Guidelines. Community removals are always carried out by Reddit Admins.
Quarantined Communities
As noted in the Content Policy, Reddit Admins may under certain circumstances apply a Quarantine to a community. In 2019, 256 communities received quarantines.
under certain circumstances
Reddit Help Center or by using the report button directly on a post or comment
Below you will find information on the volume of legal removal requests received per country, the volume of copyright removal requests, and for the first time, the volume of child sexual exploitation content removed from Reddit.
Government Requests to Remove Content
In 2019, Reddit received a total of 110 requests from 12 law enforcement and other government entities to remove or restrict access to content on the platform. Governments may request the removal of content for a variety of reasons, including alleged violations of local law. Reddit scrutinizes each request and may reject it for a variety of reasons, including that the request is overbroad or inconsistent with international law. All reported content is reviewed under our Content Policy and any violations are actioned by the appropriate team. In situations where there are no underlying Content Policy violations, Reddit may restrict access to the post in the reporter country.
Chart 9: Government requests to remove content by country
Chart 10: Reddit response to Government requests to remove content
Chart 11: Reddit removals in response to Government requests
Child Sexual Exploitation
Reports regarding CSAI are received in a number of ways:
In 2019, we made 724 Cyber Tipline reports to NCMEC.
Legal Requests submitted by Private Parties to Remove Content
Reddit complied in whole or in part with 210 of these requests. This resulted in 87 pieces of content being geoblocked in the reporter country and 223 pieces of content being removed entirely for violations of our Content Policy.
Chart 12: Private Party legal requests to remove content
When Reddit receives a complete and valid copyright notice, it complies with the notice and removes the infringing content identified in the request.
This section of the report provides data on the volume of content removed from Reddit in 2019 in response to valid copyright notices, as well as data on the content we declined to remove in response to incomplete or invalid notices. We also include data on content that was reinstated by reason of the original poster submitting a copyright counter notice or the rightsholder retracting its removal request.
In 2019, Reddit received 34,989 copyright notices, which resulted in 170,684 pieces of content being reviewed, and 124,257 content removals. In 2018, Reddit received 9,534 copyright notices, which resulted in 26,234 content removals. In 2017, Reddit received 3,130 copyright notices, which resulted in 4,352 content removals.
Chart 13: Copyright removals year-over-year
User and Subreddit Copyright Bans
In 2019, Reddit removed 283 users and 137 subreddits under our Repeat Infringer policy.
Incomplete or Invalid DMCA Notices
When Reddit receives an incomplete or invalid copyright notice, it rejects the notice and declines to remove the content identified in the request.
A request may be incomplete or invalid for many reasons, including:
In 2019, we found 46,427 pieces of content to be invalid for removal via copyright notice, because the notice was either incomplete or invalid.
Chart 14: Content identified in copyright notices to Reddit in 2019 that we declined to remove
Below are three examples of copyright notices we rejected this year because they were incomplete or invalid:
Counter Notices and Retractions
Reddit may also restore content that was removed as a result of a copyright infringement notice if the copyright owner who submitted the notice simply retracts their claim of copyright infringement.
Reddit complies with counter notices and retraction requests that are complete, and rejects those that are incomplete or invalid. In 2019, Reddit received a total of 7 counter notices and 1 retraction request. Reddit complied with the complete counter notices and retraction requests, which resulted in 3 content restorations.
This section of the report provides information on the volume of requests received in 2019, our rate of compliance, and, for the first time, the volume of US National Security requests received under the USA Patriot Act.
In accordance with our Privacy Policy and Guidelines for Law Enforcement, Reddit carefully reviews each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. If we consider the request to be overbroad or unclear, we will ask the law enforcement or the government entity to modify or refine the request.
Guidelines for Law Enforcement
Emergency Disclosure Requests
Chart 18: International Emergency Disclosure Requests - by country
Chart 19: Emergency Disclosure Requests - Global Compliance Rate
US National Security Requests
These reporting rules may work for larger companies that receive large numbers of national security requests, but they do little for smaller companies like Reddit that receive few, if any, national security requests. As others have pointed out, these disclosure rules undermine the effectiveness of this transparency report and diminish the trust our communities are able to place in us.
Chart 20: U.S. National Security Requests by Period
Preservation Requests
Chart 22: International preservation requests received
Chart 23: Preservation Requests - Global Compliance
Private Party Requests for User Information
Reddit objects to, and seeks to narrow, requests for user information submitted by private parties that are not accompanied by a court order, as well as those that seek to unmask anonymous users.
In 2019, Reddit received a total of 32 User Information Requests from private parties, and all requests were submitted from the US. This is an increase from the 14 requests received in 2018.

I need help with a hacked or compromised account
How to set up two-factor authentication
How do I deactivate my account?
Two-factor authentication adds additional security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. It requires you to give a 6-digit verification code generated from your phone in addition to your username and password login.
How do I enable two-factor authentication?
Get the code through an authenticator app
To use one of these apps:
If you lose your mobile device or cannot use your authenticator app, you can use backup codes provided by Reddit to access your account. Ten backup codes are generated. Each code can be used only one time.
We recommend you print off and store your codes in a safe location.
To generate backup codes:
How do I log in with two-factor authentication?
With your authenticator app
Sign in from a trusted computer
Submit a request to our Community team
We recommend this only if the previous options are unavailable. This process may take us several days and does not guarantee your account can be recovered.
How do I disable two-factor authentication?
To disable two-factor authentication on your Reddit account:
Will my third-party applications work with two-factor authentication?
Yes. Applications using OAuth will be supported. When signing in with your Reddit credentials, you will be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code.
However, some applications may not be using the OAuth protocol. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, and you are unable to sign in to a third-party application, you can use the following method:
While using the third-party application:
Doing so should allow you access to the app.

DIGITAL MEASUREMENT PRIVACY STATEMENT
Basis for Processing Personal Data
Data Retention and Security
Changes to This Privacy Statement
Nielsen works with various companies, including data providers, advertisers and publishers, to measure the effectiveness and reach of content viewed or listened to, no matter what kind of device people use to consume it. For example, we help advertisers better understand campaign performances across TV, computer and mobile device audiences.
Data from these other sources is also used to enhance or calibrate the data collected from our measurement software, and to enable more robust research and analyses.
Responses are voluntary, and the surveys do not ask for or collect any directly identifiable data.
In addition to processing personal data for our digital measurement services and research purposes as described above, we process personal data to:
In connection with one or more of the data use purposes described above, we may share information, including personal data, with the following recipients.
In each case, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is protected as described in this Statement.
We do not and will not sell any personal data to third parties for their own commercial use.
BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
DATA RETENTION AND SECURITY
Nielsen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the security and confidentiality of data within our control.
You may opt-out in the following ways:
Please note that if you use more than one browser, you will need to opt out on each one. Safari and Firefox users should be aware that these browsers prevent the placing of cookies which means that Nielsen is only able to capture traffic counts without being able to associate this to demographic information. This is equivalent to opting out on other browsers.
Mobile Apps: In the mobile app environment, we require each application that contains active Nielsen measurement software to disclose that measurement software is included in that app, and provide access to an opt out mechanism.
Other devices: Technologies and devices other than web browsers and mobile applications leverage unique, non-standard identifiers. How those are managed will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For internet-connected devices, we require our clients to provide functionality that enables users to opt-out of the collection of data when they leverage Nielsen measurement software.
Rights may include one or more of the following:
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity or your authority to make the request or confirm the personal data relates to you. To verify your identity, we will match data you provide when you submit your request to any personal data we already maintain.

Quantcast understands that people are concerned about privacy. We believe unwaveringly that consumers are entitled to both notice and choice across all interactive media platforms. We believe all consumers should be equipped with the information necessary to make choices. Only through transparency can we all make informed choices.
What exactly is personally identifying information?
Personally identifying information is information that identifies you directly, like your name, your mobile phone number, a photo of your face or your email address.
Why is it good to allow targeted online advertising?
Both are perfectly valid positions. In that case, here is some essential information you should have:
If you choose to opt out, what exactly are you opting out of?
By clicking on the opt out icon above, you are choosing not to receive Quantcast enabled interest-based content and advertisements in the browser you opt out from. You are also choosing not to have Quantcast measure your pattern of website browsing or other online media consumption from that browser.
When you opt out, Quantcast deletes our existing cookie identifier associated with your browser, ceases collection of personal information from that browser for advertising or measurement purposes, and ceases using any previously-collected data for targeting ads to you. We set an opt out cookie in your browser so that we can remember that you opted out. If you visit a site that is monitored by Quantcast after the opt-out cookie has been set, we would not log any personal information from the browser and we would not use any previously collected data to target ads to you.
Finally, please be aware that your opt out will not affect your Quantcast Choice selections. Quantcast Choice is another way that you can make privacy choices. See more about Quantcast Choice below.
